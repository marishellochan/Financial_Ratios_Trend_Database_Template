This Excel Database was made by me during my Summer Job at a Bank. I created this Excel database with Macros that can be customized to suit 
the relevant requirments of a business or company. This Database shows the Financial Ratios and its Trends of a particular Company/Business.
A form sheet must be filled out in order to create the database to be relevant to the business. 
Once the form is filled out and the button is clicked, the database is customized. 
Ratio data added during each quarter of the year is added and one can see if the company meets the requirement or not based on the color of the cell.
Once one year's data is entered, a sheet is created when the "Create New Year Trend" button is clicked which shows the averages and trends of each ratio for the 
quarters of that particular year. 
The "Yearly Trends" sheets shows the overall average of ratio each year on graphs. 
This template can be resetted and can be used for customization.
